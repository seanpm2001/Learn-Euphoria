-- About:
-- I decided to make Euphoria the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Euphoria) as Euphoria is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Euphoria programming language. It only makes sense to Euphoria the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
